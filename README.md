# Leapfrog_Final_Project_Intern

We have seen tremendous research going on in medical imaging by utilizing available medical CT scan images and xray images.
On November 15, 2017, Stanford researchers have developed an algorithm that offers diagnoses based on chest X-ray images.
It can diagnose up to 14 types of medical conditions and is able to diagnose pneumonia better than expert radiologists working alone.
Thus, it is possible to use Deep Learning algorithms to detect the disease from images of Chest X-rays and CT scans.
Automated applications can be created to help support radiologists.
So,this project aims to detect pneumonia cases from the x-ray images.
This project will be an end to end solution where the user/radiologist will upload the chest x-ray image to the app and the app would return the predictions denoting whether the patient has pneumonia or not.
